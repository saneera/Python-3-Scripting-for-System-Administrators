## Working with Environment Variables

python support following library and function to work on environment variable

 os package
 os.environ attributes
 os.getenv
 
 BY importing os package we are able to access a lot of operating system level attributes and functions
 
 -/bin/running
 
 ```
   #!/usr/bin/env python3.7

  import os

  stage = os.getenv("STAGE", "dev").upper()

  output = f"We're running in {stage}"

  if stage.startswith("PROD"):
      output = "DANGER!!! - " + output

  print(output)
  
 ```
 
 give the executable permission to the file 
 
 ```
 chmod u+x bin/running
 ```
 
 execute using command running
 
 ```
  $ running
  We're running in DEV
  $ STAGE=prod running
  DANGER!!! - We're running in PROD

 ```
