## REPL -- Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

Python is interpreted langunage and code isevaluated by line-by-line 

REPL is stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

Each line read, eveluated, then return value printed on the screen, and then process repeats

Python comes with REPL, and we can access it by running python3.7 using teminal

```
  $ python3.7
  Python 3.7.3 (default, May 31 2019, 05:13:04)
  [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-36)] on linux
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>>
```

The >>> indicates that you can type on that line

```
  >>> 1+1
  2
  >>> print('Hello Python')
  Hello Python
  >>>
```

Lastly, to exit the REPL, you can either type exit() (the parentheses are important), or you can hit Ctrl+d on your keyboard.
