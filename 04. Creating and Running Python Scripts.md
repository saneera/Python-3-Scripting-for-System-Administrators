## Creating and Running Python Scripts

To create a Python script we can create a file ending with the file extension of .py.

### Creating Our First Python Script

Let’s create our first script to write our obligatory “Hello, World!” program:

```
  $ vim hello.py
```

From inside this file, we can enter the lines of Python that we need. For the “Hello, World!” example we only need:

```
  $ python3.6 hello.py
  Hello, World!
```

### Setting a Shebang

You’ll most likely want your scripts to be:

Executable from anywhere (in our $PATH).
Executable without explicitly using the python3.7 CLI.

hello.py
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3.7
print("Hello, World")
```

now we need to make the file executable using chmod: 

```
$ chmod u+x hello.py
```

Run the script now by using ./hello.py and we’ll see the same result. 
If we’d rather not have a file extension on our script, we can now remove that 
since we’ve put a shebang in the file mv hello.py hello, and running ./hello will still result in the same thing. 

### Adding Scripts to Our $PATH

Now we need to make sure that we can put this in our $PATH. 
For this course, we’ll be using a bin directory in our $HOME folder to store our custom scripts,
but scripts can go into any directory that is in your $PATH. 

Let’s create a bin directory and move our script: 

```
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ mv hello ~/bin/
```

Here’s how we add this directory to the $PATH in our .bashrc (the .bashrc for this course already contains this): 

```
$ export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Finally, run the hello script from our $PATH: 

```
$ hello
Hello, World!
```
